# Sequencing-animations-MDN

My version of MDN's assessment: Sequencing animations

The objective of this assignment is "to test understanding of how to use promise-based APIs". This is tested by having the user animate three images one after the other. For instance, the second image will not animate unless the first image has finished its animation. The user is challenged to implement this using "three different ways of using promises": callback, promise chain, async and await
